General Information
===================

This is version 3.8.0 of gedit-latex. gedit-latex is a plugin that provides
features to ease the edition of latex documents.

Note about Python 3
===================

Gedit-latex needs the dbus module for python to be installed. In python 3, this module
is not installed by default on many distributions.

Installation
============

Due to a limitation on reading Settings, the plugin currently must
be installed in the same prefix as gedit. For instance if you are using
gedit 3 from your distribution, you need to do

./configure --prefix=/usr
make
sudo make install

If you are using a 64bit distribution, you also need to pass --libdir=/usr/lib64
to ./configure script.
